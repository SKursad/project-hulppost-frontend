     this makes the webapp. more dynamic for the user
     if he/she wants to change the font size.
     Rem goes to the root element of the webapp witch is the html element.
     The browser default defines the size for the root element.
     The font size always depends on the browser settings,
     the user has the full control of the size he/she wants.
     That's why is better to specify all the font sizes with rem.
